# Tanakascheme
Tanaka algorithm implementation
The TANAKA scheme is a method often used for privacy-preserving deep learning, particularly in medical image analysis. It allows secure training and inference by applying encryption techniques to the neural network computations. Here's an implementation outline for a DNN-based medical image classification task using the TANAKA scheme:

Steps to Implement TANAKA Scheme

1. Encrypt Medical Image Data:

Use homomorphic encryption (or a similar approach) to encrypt the input medical image.

Ensure the encryption supports mathematical operations like addition and multiplication directly on the ciphertext.



2. Preprocess the Image:

Convert the medical image into a matrix of pixel values.

Encrypt these values using the TANAKA scheme.



3. Modify the Neural Network:

Adjust the neural network layers to work with encrypted data.

This may involve approximating non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU) with polynomial functions for compatibility with encrypted computations.



4. Perform Encrypted Inference:

Feed the encrypted image through the DNN.

Compute each layer's output on encrypted data without decryption.



5. Decrypt and Interpret the Results:

Once the model produces the encrypted output, decrypt it to reveal the classification result.


Key Points

1. Encryption: The TANAKA scheme ensures privacy by encrypting sensitive medical data.


2. Compatibility: Neural network layers are adjusted to work seamlessly with encrypted data.


3. Efficiency: Operations on encrypted data are computationally intensive, so optimization is crucial.
